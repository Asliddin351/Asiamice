Here, more than 300 days a year, you can enjoy the clear sunny sky during the day and the velvet starry canvas at night. In Uzbekistan, the warmth of the sun is intertwined with the warmth and hospitality of human souls, which is why every cell of the body feels a powerful synergy of kindness and comfort.

            "part2": "Nature has generously endowed Uzbekistan with an amazing variety of landscapes: the hot sands of the Kyzyl Kum mountains coexist with lakes of stunning freshness and purity; lifeless steppes alternate with green oases, where it is so pleasant to drink the honey of the sweetest melon in the shade of vines; here, from the noisy metropolitan road, gray ridges of the Tien Shan are visible in the distant haze, and the breeze blowing down from the mountains brings the pristine freshness and mountain coolness to Tashkent. Fertile valleys with blossoming orchards, huge fields of white gold - cotton, thousands of mountain sais, merging into the powerful channels of the Amu Darya and Syr Darya, ancient cities, where from high minarets you can see both snowy peaks and lifeless sands - all this is Uzbekistan. During its long history, the Uzbek land has seen a lot: the rise and fall of the powerful empires of Alexander the Great, Genghis Khan and Amir Temur, destructive wars, the rise of scientific thought and the construction of masterpieces of architecture. Uzbekistan has repeatedly become a crossroads of worlds, where different cultures and civilizations met: thousands of rich caravans of the Great Silk Road passed here, which connected the Middle East and the Mediterranean with India and China. New cities flourished along the life-giving arteries of caravan roads, the national cuisine absorbed the best recipes of overseas dishes, the secrets of which were willingly shared by passing merchants. Today Uzbekistan is a modern democratic republic with excellent service and developed tourist infrastructure. Here, everyone will be able to afford an affordable vacation - whether it be the five-star comfort of first-class hotels or a humble national home, an exciting jeep adventure or hiking trip in the mountains, a languid beach vacation or an active tour of ancient cities with their countless attractions. We are waiting for you on the hospitable Asian land! Useful information for traveling in Uzbekistan:"

In hot weather, it will be advisable to carry sunglasses, a light hat in the form of a hat or cap, and sunscreen at all times. Do not forget about comfortable shoes, because most of the excursion programs are walking. It is recommended to take shoes not only comfortable, but also practical, with a strong sole and without high female heels, because excursions can also take place along a rocky or dusty road. In early spring (March - early April) and late autumn (October - November), it will not be superfluous to take a windbreaker, jacket and thin sweater with you. In winter, the temperature can drop to minus 3-8 ° C, so the best option is a raincoat or a warm jacket and a hat. If you are also going to visit the mountains or the desert, you should take into account that the differences between day and night temperatures there can be significant, in addition, in the mountains it is usually much cooler than in cities. Of course, you need to remember about respect for local traditions, culture and religion. Therefore, when visiting religious places of worship, be sure to have a scarf or shawl with you to cover your head and shoulders. Please also note that it is customary to take off your shoes when visiting houses of worship in Uzbekistan. You should not dress provocatively or wear too bright jewelry, so as not to cause misunderstandings on the part of residents of remote regions of Uzbekistan."

The fact that hospitality is the norm for the inhabitants of Uzbekistan is no secret to anyone, although sometimes it causes considerable surprise among tourists. In response to such a kind and sincere attitude, guests often try to somehow thank the hosts. At such a reciprocal gesture from the guest, most Uzbeks shrug their shoulders in bewilderment and even take offense: “Why ?! After all, we wholeheartedly!  But in Uzbekistan, as in any country where there is tourism, the concept of service workers is also present. And indeed, how to do without such important tourism professions as guides, tour guides, translators, drivers, waiters and others - all these people directly depend on the quality of tourism programs, and they all show care and attention to tourists. In relation to the service staff, a gesture of gratitude from the guest will be quite appropriate. Therefore, if you really liked how you were served in a restaurant, how you were taken from one city to another, how they conducted an excursion, how they translated, making the boundaries between languages ​​transparent, or how they helped, willingly and willingly trying to solve any questions and problems, - do not hesitate to thank you for your work.

In addition, blue is the original color of the Turkic people, to which the Uzbeks belong. The white stripe of the flag is a symbol of peace, traditional for the population of the republic, a wish of a good journey (ok yul), a desire for moral purity of thoughts and actions. Green is the color of nature, new life (Navruz) and fertility. And besides, green is the color of Islam. Red stripes flanking the middle (white) stripe above and below emphasize the vitality of every living organism. In addition, the people consider these two strips to be blood vessels that feed the land of Uzbekistan - the Amu Darya and Syrdarya rivers. The young crescent moon on the flag of Uzbekistan is seen as a symbol of the newly born independent Muslim republic. The 12 stars on the flag were considered by all peoples as a symbol of a cloudless sky. The veneration of 12 stars reminds of the solar year starting from Navruz - the time of the onset of spring. The 12-year solar cycle in Uzbekistan is called Muchal. In the minds of Eastern philosophers, the number 12 is a sign of inclusiveness and perfection.
